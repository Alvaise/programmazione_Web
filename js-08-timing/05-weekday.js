 * Write a function getWeekDay(date) to show the weekday in short format:
 * ‘MO’, ‘TU’, ‘WE’, ‘TH’, ‘FR’, ‘SA’, ‘SU’.
 *      ● Write another function that does the same in Italian.
 *      ● Add a language parameter to the function that accepts ‘en’ or ‘it’ and
 *        outputs the day in the correct language.
