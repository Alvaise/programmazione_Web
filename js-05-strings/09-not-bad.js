 * Exercise on Strings in Javascript
 * 
 * Create a function called notBad that takes a single argument, a string.
 * It should find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 'bad'.
 * If the 'bad' follows the 'not', then it should replace the whole 'not'...'bad'
 * substring with 'good' and return the result.
 * If it doesn't find 'not' and 'bad' in the right sequence (or at all), just return
 * the original sentence.
