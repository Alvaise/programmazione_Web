            Darth Plagueis (pronounced /'pleɪɡ.əs/) was a Force-sensitive Muun male Dark Lord of the Sith and the Sith Master of <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious"> Darth Sidious</a>. Plagueis lusted for immortality, believing the secret laid in science. To that end, he worked with his Sith apprentice, conducting research into bioengineering and experimenting with his ability to influence the midi-chlorians to create life. In doing so, Plagueis acquired considerable knowledge of the Force, but he was ultimately betrayed and murdered by his own apprentice in accordance with the Rule of Two. Sidious later recounted the tale of his master's demise to lure the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force, calling the fallen Sith Lord <strong>Darth Plagueis the Wise</strong>. After his own demise, Sidious used his master's teachings to cheat death, though true immortality still eluded him up until his final end.

        <h2>Biografia</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3><a name="Early life"></a>Early life </h3>
        <p>Plagueis was a legendary[7] Dark Lord of the Sith[3] trained by the Sith Master Darth Tenebrous.[5] At some point during his life, Plagueis acquired the protocol droid 11-4D.[8] During his time as a Sith Lord and studying the Force, Plagueis acquired a vast amount of knowledge about the dark side and its teachings</p>
        <h3><a name="Master of Darth Sidious"> </a>Master of Darth Sidious</h3>
        <p>The time period of when Plagueis came to possess his Sith apprentice was unknown,[9] but the Dark Lord chose <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Darth_Sidious" target="_blank">Sheev Palpatine</a>, a human from Naboo, as his apprentice. As master and disciple, Plagueis and Palpatine—who took the Sith moniker Darth Sidious—worked together for years, trying to unlock the secrets of immortality as Plagueis lusted for it[8] and to execute the Sith Order's long-percolating plan of supplanting the Galactic Republic with a new Sith Empire.[10]

            While training Sidious, Plagueis taught him that two Sith were required for their perilous machinations. So, if they worked together in accordance to the Rule of Two, with one of them serving as a bait for the dark side of the Force and the other as a vessel, they would succeed in acquiring the ability to harness the full power of the dark side and rule immortal for ten thousand years.[8] While apprenticed by Plagueis, Sidious also built his own lightsabers.[11] Plagueis attempted to forge a Force dyad with Sidious, a unique Force-bond as strong as life itself and which was the predecessor to the Rule of Two. However, Plagueis was unsuccessful in forming the dyad.[12]

            Believing the secrets to immortality lie in science, Plagueis conducted in-depth research into the biological underpinnings of life. Some of that research constituted unnatural experiments, through his ability to coax the midi-chlorians, in an attempt to cheat death, that, though incomplete, were encouraging to his apprentice.[9] The Sith Order had long coveted the ability to live forever, unwilling to accept the Jedi Order's belief that death was a natural part of life, but over the centuries generations of Sith Lords failed to unlock the ability that led to eternal life.[4] He was so obsessed with the subject that he ignored the signs that his "faithful apprentice" was progressing in a disturbing way for him.[13]
            
            According to Darth Sidious' book, The Secrets of the Sith, Plagueis discovered a form of immortality through transference, a Force power that allowed the user to transfer his consciousness to another body, essentially using bodies as vessels.[4]
            
            Darth Plagueis had arranged for his apprentice to become the Senator of Naboo and the rest of the Chommell sector.[13] By the time that Sidious, under his public persona of Sheev Palpatine, was appointed to the Galactic Senate as the Senator of Naboo, Plagueis was still teaching him,[8] which allowed Palpatine to sharpen his political skills within the plan imagined for him by his master, before they returned to Coruscant.[13] </p>
        <h3><a name="The Death of Darth Plagueis"></a> The Death of darth Plagueis</h3> 
        <p>According to Sidious, Plagueis was powerful enough that he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life and keep the ones he cared about from dying, a precious knowledge that awarded him the epithet of "The Wise."[6] However, Plagueis also developed a belief that the Force could "strike back" at him for his power.[8] In truth, he became so powerful that the only thing he still dreaded was losing his powerUltimately, Plagueis' only fear was bound to come true; at some point, Sidious had learned everything he needed from his[3] distracted master,[13] after which he decided that he had no further use for his teacher. In accordance with the Rule of Two tradition,[9] Sidious broke into his master's apartment[13] and disposed of Plagueis, murdering his mentor in cold blood, killing him in his sleep,[3] and ascending to ultimate power and acquiring the title of Sith Master for himself.[9] As noted by Sidious, Plagueis didn't act fast enough to prevent his own demise.Sometime before or after Plagueis' demise, Sidious acquired his own pupil in the Nightsister Mother Talzin's son, Darth Maul,[6] a young Dathomirian Zabrak whom Sidious had kidnapped from Talzin when he was only a child.</p>

        <p>
            Darth Plagueis il Saggio <br>
            Con potere sulla vita e la morte,<br>
            Ma la sua arroganza e sete di potere,<br>
            Gli causò la fine della sorte. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Poteva salvare i suoi cari,<br>
            Ma non il destino dei suoi nemici,<br>
            E così il suo apprendista lo uccise,<br>
            Nella notte oscura e silenziosa. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ma la lezione è chiara e semplice, <br>
            Che l'avidità porta solo distruzione, <br>
            E che l'equilibrio è la via vera, <br>
            Per avere pace e protezione. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Quindi ricorda, caro Jedi, <br>
            Di non seguire la via del lato oscuro, <br>
            Ma di mantenere l'equilibrio interiore, <br>
            Per evitare la fine di Darth Plagueis il Saggio. <br>
