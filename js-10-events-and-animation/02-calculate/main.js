 * Exercise on event in Javascript
 * Use the functions from the previous calculator exercises
 * For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and when it's
 * clicked, find the value of the appropriate input and show the result of the
 * calculation in the solution div
 * Afterwards, change the code so that you respond to key presses so that the
 * user doesn't have to click the button
