 * Exercise on event in Javascript
 * ● The cat should start from the left side of the screen
 * ● Write a function ‘catWalk()’ that moves the cat 10 pixels to the right
 * ● Make the cat move across the screen by calling that function every 50ms
 * ● Write different versions of the function to handle the following variants:
 * ○ Variant 1: When the cat reaches the right side of the screen it should restart from the left
 * ○ Variant 2: When the cat reaches the right side of the screen, it should move backwards.
 *  When it reaches the left it should move forwards
 * ○ Variant 3: When the cat reaches the middle of the screen, replace the img with a different
 *  cat image. Keep it in the middle for 10 seconds, and then replace the img with the original
 * image and have it continue the walk as in variant 2
